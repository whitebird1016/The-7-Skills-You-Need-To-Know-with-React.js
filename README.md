# The-7-Skills-You-Need-To-Know-with-React.js

<h2>Step 1: Become confident with the core fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>

The first step in learning React is actually somewhat of a step backwards.

The building blocks of the web and every single webpage are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Any good React developer should know how to use them. React builds upon them to help you create apps that run on the web.

If you’ve built something with HTML, CSS and JavaScript already, you’re in a good place. For example, if you’ve built a complete landing page or a small website.

Out of the three technologies, React is most connected with JavaScript. React is JavaScript, with some added features. For that reason, you’ll need to have solid JavaScript skills.

<b>What JavaScript concepts should you know for React?</b>

<ul>
<li>Basic data structures: variables, objects, and arrays</li>
<li>Array methods and working with array data: .map(), .filter(), and .reduce()</li>
<li>Be very familiar with functions and a little bit with classes</li>
<li>Asynchronous JavaScript: promises, making HTTP requests with Fetch API, async/await syntax can help</li>
<li>The DOM: learn to create, select and modify HTML elements as well as their attributes</li>
<li>Object and array destructuring are helpful for working with data</li></ul>

Many developers claim that you should know "ES6/ES7/ES8/ESNext JavaScript" (in other words, the latest JavaScript features) to better learn React. Knowing more JavaScript can help, but new features can also serve as a distraction for new learners.

First, become confident with the JavaScript concepts I've listed above by building some small projects that require JavaScript. After that, you can take a look at some newer features of the language.
